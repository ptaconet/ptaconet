### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I'm a postdoc researcher at the French Research Institute for Sustainable Development [(IRD)](https://en.ird.fr/home-page), in the unit : *Infectious Diseases and Vectors: Ecology, Genetics, Evolution, and Control* [(MIVEGEC)](https://mivegec.fr/en) 
- I'm interested in Geospatial Data Science applied to environmental sciences (in general) and bio-ecology (in particular)
- I'm addicted to R and I like to develop open, reproducible and as-much-as-possible reusable R scripts, that I share in this repo ! 
- I have expertise in Geographic Information Systems, Remote Sensing, Biostatistics, Machine learning, Spatial Relational Databases, Spatial (Meta)Data management
- I have a [PhD](https://theses.hal.science/tel-03841709) in geospatial data mining with a thematic focus on the bio-ecology of mosquitoes vectors of diseases from the University of Montpellier
- I am a strong supporter of the Open Science movement ! 

This GitHub repo contains the R scipts that I have developed over time, including :

- operational R packages ([`modisfast`](https://github.com/ptaconet/modisfast))
- under-development R packages ([`eodataflow`](https://github.com/ptaconet/eodataflow), [`getremotedata`](https://github.com/ptaconet/getremotedata), [`shub4r`](https://github.com/ptaconet/shub4r))
- archived R packages ([`rtunaatlas`](https://github.com/ptaconet/rtunaatlas))
- teaching material ([`td_renovbati_montpellier`](https://github.com/ptaconet/td_renovbati_montpellier), [`formation_initiation_teledetection`](https://github.com/ptaconet/formation_initiation_teledetection), [`td_anopheles_environnement`](https://github.com/ptaconet/td_anopheles_environnement))
- temporary R scripts developed in side-projects ([`modeling_vector_mtp`](https://github.com/ptaconet/modeling_vector_mtp))
