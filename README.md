### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I'm a postdoc researcher at the French Research Institute for Sustainable Development [(IRD)](https://en.ird.fr/home-page), in the Infectious Diseases and Vectors: Ecology, Genetics, Evolution, and Control [(MIVEGEC)](https://mivegec.fr/en) unit
- I'm interested in Geospatial Data Science applied to environmental sciences in general and bio-ecological systems in particular
- I'm addicted to R and I like to develop open, reproducible and as-much-as-possible reusable R scripts, that I share in this repo ! 
- I have expertise in Geographic Information Systems, Remote Sensing, Biostatistics, Machine learning, Spatial Relational Databases, Spatial Metadata management
- I have a [PhD](https://theses.hal.science/tel-03841709) in geospatial data mining with a thematic focus on the bio-ecology of mosquitoes vectors of diseases from the University of Montpellier
- I am a strong supporter of the Open Science movement !
