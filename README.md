### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I'm a postdoc researcher at the [French Research Institute for Sustainable Development (IRD)](https://en.ird.fr/home-page), in the [Infectious Diseases and Vectors: Ecology, Genetics, Evolution, and Control (MIVEGEC)](https://mivegec.fr/en) unit
- I'm interested in Geospatial Data Science applied to environmental sciences in general and bio-ecology in particular (how can data and models help exploring, explaining and predicting complex bio-ecological systems)
- I'm addicted to R and I like to develop open, reproducible and as-much-as-possible reusable and generic R scripts, that I share here ! 
- I have expertise in Geospatial Data Science and more particularly Geographic Information Systems, Remote Sensing, Spatial Modeling (including biostatistics and machine learning), Spatial Relational Databases, Spatial Metadata management
- I have a [PhD](https://theses.hal.science/tel-03841709) in geospatial data mining, with a thematic focus on the bio-ecology of mosquitoes vectors of diseases
- I am a strong supporter of the Open Science movement !
